# Learning Laravel Series
This is a series designed to show off various features of Laravel in fun, 
easily consumable projects. Iâ€™ll be keeping track of the entire series 
in my public GitHub repo and including the instructions for keeping your 
own project up to date with mine. For fun, I decided to create these 
projects around the theme of Carmen Sandiego, an international thief who 
has appeared in video games and television shows since 1985.
