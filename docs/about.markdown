This is a series designed to show off various features of the Laravel framework in fun, easily consumable projects.
Iâ€™ll be keeping track of the entire series in my public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/krievley/learning-laravel) and
including the instructions for keeping your own project up to date with mine. For fun, I decided to create these
projects around the theme of Carmen Sandiego, an international thief who has appeared in video games and television
shows since 1985.
