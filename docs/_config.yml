# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Learning Laravel
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This is a series designed to show off various features of Laravel in fun,
  easily consumable projects. I’ll be keeping track of the entire series
  in my public GitHub repo and including the instructions for keeping your
  own project up to date with mine. For fun, I decided to create these
  projects around the theme of Carmen Sandiego, an international thief who
  has appeared in video games and television shows since 1985.
